Updates: Since November 2023 I started to work as a postdoc, which focuses more on the analysis of brain MRI, genomic and proteomic data.

I am currently doing my PhD at the Biomedical Imaging Group Rotterdam [(BIGR)](https://bigr.nl/) at [Erasmus MC](https://www.erasmusmc.nl/en/) under the supervision of [Prof. Wiro J. Niessen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jmKtufcAAAAJ&hl=en), [Prof. Eppo B. Wolvius](https://www.erasmusmc.nl/nl-nl/patientenzorg/zorgverleners/wolvius-eppo), and [Dr. Gennady V. Roshchupkin](https://www.roshchupkin.org/). Earlier, Iâ€™ve completed my Bachelors and Masters from [Shenzhen University](https://en.szu.edu.cn/), and gained industrial experience as a R&D engineer at [Shenzhen Wisonic Co., Ltd](https://www.wisonic.com/en/). and a computer vision researcher at [Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/en/) in collaboration with [Esquel Group](https://www.esquel.com/).

I mainly work on the interpretability and confounding problems in deep learning, with applications in population-based genetic and epidemiological studies, by using multimodal data sets (e.g., 2D/3D facial images, brain MRI, genomic data) from the [Generation R Study](https://generationr.nl/researchers/) and the [Rotterdam Study](https://www.erasmusmc.nl/en/research/core-facilities/ergo-the-rotterdam-study). I significantly contributed to the craniofacial shape analysis

I have extensive collaborations. For internal collaborations within Erasmus MC, I work closely with [Manfred Kayser](https://www.erasmusmc.nl/en/research/researchers/kayser-manfred) from department of genetic identification, and [Marlies Wakkee](https://www.erasmusmc.nl/nl-nl/kankerinstituut/patientenzorg/zorgverleners/wakkee-marlies) from department of dermatology. For external collaborations, I work closely with the  school of public health of Harvard University, the school of public health and primary care of Chinese University of Hong Kong, and the school of design of Hong Kong Polytechnic University. Please find my [publication list](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=m2qycVQAAAAJ&hl=en) for the research output from these collaborations.

I am also active in educational activities. I have supervised 6 master students from Technical University of Delft (TUD) for 9-month thesis or 10-week internship.
